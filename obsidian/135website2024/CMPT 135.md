This site has the lecture notes for **CMPT 135 in Spring 2024 at SFU Surrey**. [Canvas](https://canvas.sfu.ca) is where you'll find course marks, due dates, assignment marking schemes, discussions, announcements, etc. 

## Useful Links
CMPT 135 uses modern C++ in Linux/Unix, and you should try to set up Linux on your own computer:

- If you're using **Windows**, I recommend you follow these instructions: [[Using VS Code to Run C++]].
- If you have a **Mac**, you can use the Terminal that comes with it and install the necessary software for this course (`g++`, `make`, and `valgrind`) using a package manager such as [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).  You could also try [installing a virtual machine on Mac](https://www.macworld.com/article/668848/best-virtual-machine-software-for-mac.html) that runs Ubuntu.

> Please make the effort to get C++ running on your own computer. It might take a bit of work the first time, but it's something that all software developers should be able to do.

If for some reason none of the choices above work for you, then you could:
- try [[Setting up a Linux a virtual machine]]
- use the computers in CSIL
- try running C++ on using a web-based environment [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or [repl.it](http://repl.it)

**Ncurses** is a library that gives you more control over the cursor on the screen, and it might be used in some examples or assignments. Here are some instructions for [[setting up ncurses on Ubuntu Linux]].
