# Order and Chaos

*Order and Chaos* is a 2-player game played on a 6-by-6 (or bigger) grid of
squares. One player is *Order*, the other is *Chaos*. They take turns placing
either an *X* or an *O* in an empty square. *Order* wins if they make 5 *X*s or
*O*s in a line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), and *Chaos* wins if
they can prevent this.

An unusual feature of this game is that, on each turn, players choose to play
either an *X* or and *O*.

For this assignment, your task is to implement *Order and Chaos* allowing a
human player to play against the computer.

## Working with a Partner

If you like, you can work with a partner on this assignment. To set this up, you
and your partner should join an assignment 5 group on Canvas.

If you do work with a partner, keep this in mind:

- Both partners will get the same mark.
- Only one partner submits the assignment on Canvas, as part of the team.
- Both partners should do an equal amount of programming work, and understand
  the entire program. **We may ask questions of either partner about how any of
  the code works**.
- Teams of *more* than 2 are *not* allowed under any circumstances.
- It's fine if you want to work on your own: you don't need to join a team in
  that case.


## Requirements

### Basic Features: 15 marks
- **1 mark**: Display instructions for the human at the start of the game.
- **1 mark**: The game is played on a 6-by-6 grid of squares. 
- **1 mark**: In addition to a 6x6 grid size, the user can also choose grids of
  size 7x7, 8x8, or 9x9.
- **1 mark**: The human player is randomly assigned to be either *Order* or
  *Chaos*.
- **1 mark**: The human moves first or second at random.
- **1 mark**: The human types their moves in some easy way (e.g. by entering the
  coordinates of the square they want to place their piece in).
- **1 mark**: Moves entered by the user are checked for validity. A move is
  valid if it refers to an empty square on the board. If a move is invalid, then
  the user is asked to re-enter their move. 
- **3 marks** 1 mark if the computer can play any strategy at all. 2 marks if
  the computer can play random moves. 3 marks if the computer can play better
  than random moves, e.g. it blocks the human from making obvious 5-in-a-lines.
  Try to make the computer play as intelligently as possible. The computer
  should *never* resign.
- **3 marks**: Correctly recognizing the game is over when one of these things
  occurs:
  - The human resigns. In this case, the human loses and the computer wins.
  - *Order* makes 5 *X*s or *O*s in a line (horizontally, vertically, or
    diagonally). In this case *Order* wins, and *Chaos* loses.
  - There are no empty squares left on the board, and there is no line of 5 *X*s
    or *O*s. In this case, *Chaos* wins and *Order* loses.
- **1 mark**: When the game is over, display a message indicating who won.
- **1 mark**: After a game ends, the user is asked if they want to play again.
  If they say yes, then start a new game. If they say no, then exit the program.

### Use of Classes: 2 marks
- **1 mark**: A class named `GameBoard` is used to represent the playing board.
- **1 mark**: At least one other class/struct is used in a sensible way. For
  example, you could use a struct to represent a player, storing whether they
  are *Order* or *Chaos*, and whether they are human or computer.

### User Interface and Source Code Readability: 8 marks
- **3 marks** Quality of the user interface. It should be both easy to read
  and look nice. 
- **5 marks**: Code readability and style.
  - All code is sensibly and consistently indented, and all lines are 100
    characters in length, or less.
  - Whitespace is used to group related pieces of a code to make it easier for
    humans to read. All whitespace has a purpose.
  - Variable and function names are self-descriptive.
  - Appropriate features of C++ are used, as discussed in class and in the
    notes. **Note** If you use a feature that we haven't discussed in class,
    **you must explain it in a comment**, even if you think it's obvious.
  - Comments are used when needed to explain chunks of code whose purpose is not
    obvious from the code itself. There should be *no* commented-out code from
    previous versions.

### Report: 5 marks
- **4 marks**: The "Assignment 5 Report" in [a5_report.txt](a5_report.txt) is
  complete and appended, in comments, to the end of the file [a5.cpp](a5.cpp). 1
  mark for filling in each section; trivial efforts might not get full marks.
- **1 mark**: the report is neatly formatted, uses full sentences, good grammar,
  and correct spelling.

### Deductions

- **-1 mark** (at least) if your file does not have the correct name, or you
  submit it in the incorrect format.
- up to **-3 marks** if you do not include your full name, email, and SFU ID in
  the header of your file.
- **A score of 0** if one or more of the following are true:
  - You *don't* include the "Statement of Originality", or it is modified in any
    way.
  - You use code from some other source (e.g. the web, the textbook, ChatGPT, a
    friend, a teacher, a TA...) *without* citing the source.
  - You submit a "wrong" non-working file, and then *after the due date* submit
    the "right" file. If you can provide evidence that you finished the
    assignment on time, then it may be marked.
- **-5 marks** for any *memory leaks*, or other errors, reported by `valgrind`.
  `valgrind` is run like this:

  ```console
  > valgrind ./some_prog
    
  // ... lots of output ... 
  ```

  A program is considered to have **no memory leaks** if:

  - In the `LEAK SUMMARY`, `definitely lost`, `indirectly lost`, and
    `possibly lost` are all 0.
  - `ERROR SUMMARY` reports 0 errors.
  
  If `valgrind` reports any errors for a run of your program, your assignment
  will get a deduction as described below.

  **Note** It *may* be okay if **still reachable** reports a non-zero number of
  bytes. It usually means that some memory was not de-allocated when your
  program finished. That could be because you forgot to de-allocate the memory,
  or, it *might* be that the compiler optimized-away de-allocation statements in
  cases where it knows the program will immediately end (the operating system
  will clean up any memory a finished program hasn't de-allocated). **Rule of
  thumb**: assume that **still reachable** means you have forgotten a delete
  statement somewhere. Carefully check that you haven't left out any delete
  statements before concluding that it is due to a compiler optimization.
  
There may be other deductions, depending upon the circumstances.

## Constraints

You can #include any standard C++ libraries, i.e. any libraries that come with
every C++17 compiler. Code and files from the web are *not* allowed: all the
code in your program should be written by you.

As always, you must cite all help you get. If a website, book, person, etc.
helps you with this assignment, then cite their help in the report at the end.


## Submitting Your Work

On Canvas, please submit just the file [a5.cpp](a5.cpp) with your answers in it.
Don't submit anything else. Remember to append your
[a5_report.txt](a5_report.txt), in comments, to the end of the file.

The marker will compile your [a5.cpp](a5.cpp) using 
[the standard course makefile](makefile). 

**No other files will be in the folder your program is compiled in**. In
particular, [cmpt_error.h](cmpt_error.h) and [cmpt_trace.h](cmpt_trace.h) will
*not* be in the folder when your [a5.cpp](a5.cpp) is compiled.


## Hints

You *can*, but are *not required*, to use inheritance, recursion, pointers, etc.
Only use a feature if it makes sense to use it.

A good way to start this program is to create the `GameBoard` class that
represents the board, and has a method to print it. Then add a method such as
`make_user_move()` that, when called, asks the user to enter a move and plays it
on the board (re-asking if they enter an invalid move). Continue to add methods
and features, testing each as you go.

Your board could be drawn like this:

```
   1 2 3 4 5 6
 a . . . . . .
 b . . . . . .
 c . . X . . .
 d . . . X . .
 e . . . . X .
 f . . . . . O
```

For instance, the *O* in the bottom-right corner is at position "f6". 

For entering moves, you could, as shown above, label each row of the board with
a letter, and each column with a number. If the user enters "a3x" on the board
above, the board will look like this:

```
   1 2 3 4 5 6
 a . . X . . .
 b . . . . . .
 c . . X . . .
 d . . . X . .
 e . . . . X .
 f . . . . . O
```
